# Network Accessor Trait

API for querying neighbor information and block inventories. Some state machines need to read state in others, but we donâ€™t want to block implementation work by waiting for dependent state machines to be available.

## Dependencies

- none

## Requirements

- An API for iterating through the list of neighbors
- For each neighbor, this reports
- whether or not the neighbor is authenticated
- whether or not it is inbound or outbound
- estimated in-degree and out-degree of the neighbor
- last contact time
- last seen block height of this neighbor
- whether or not this neighbor is a bootstrap peer
- which stacker DBs this neighbor subscribes to
- NeighborKey
- An API for getting the block inventories from neighbors

## Testable interfaces

- All of the above

## Properties of a successful implementation

- This trait can be implemented for PeerNetwork and can be mocked for tests
- We can use this trait in some form for working on multiple network stack upgrades in parallel

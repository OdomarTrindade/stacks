UPDATE: Stacks 2.0 was successfully launched by independent miners on Jan 14th, 2021.

# What is Stacks 2.0?
Stacks 2.0 is a new layer-1 blockchain that uses [Proof-of-Transfer (PoX)](https://blockstack.org/pox.pdf) to connect to Bitcoin. Stacks 2.0 brings apps and [predictable smart contracts](https://clarity-lang.org)
to Bitcoin. Assets and contracts are secured by Bitcoin, and STX holders can earn BTC by participating in consensus. See an [earnings calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJ_pFQ8njpsBPYtWV9bXRx_aJejeXIkQwwiZzuWhvZQ/edit#gid=505229599) and a [community intro video](http://stacks.zone/#IntroVideo)). 

# When is Stacks 2.0 mainnet launching? 

Stacks 2.0 is currently [being implemented](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain)
in the Rust language, and the mainnet launch is divided into [four testnet phases](https://www.blockstack.org/testnet).

We're in the home stretch. Stacks 2.0 is on track to reach code completion by Dec 15th. Mainnet launch is set for Jan 14th 2021. Xenon the Stacks 2.0 Phase 4 is currently in the implementation phase. Microblocks is one feature that will be implemented in Phase 4 in addition to testing. Here is a status visual from testnet.blockstack.org (as of Nov 19th):
